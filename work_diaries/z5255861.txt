Week 1

- Formed groups during our first lab, after introductions we set our communication channels, discussed experience
    and from there decided what roles each member would be best suited for.
- Talked about possible functionalities listing down a couple of them and created a google doc on what functionalities 
    we would potentially like to see.

Week 2
- Worked on what requirements we were going to keep ensuring that our functionalities were achievable.
- Set up code base
