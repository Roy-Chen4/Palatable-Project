Week 1

- Formed groups during our first lab, after introductions we set our communication channels, discussed experience
    and from there decided what roles each member would be best suited for.
- Talked about possible functionalities listing down a couple of them and created a google doc on what functionalities 
    we would potentially like to see.

Week 2
- Worked on what requirements we were going to keep ensuring that our functionalities were achievable.
- Set up Django and React skeleton
- Double checked that React component was linked with Django
- Updated and allocated functionalities to team (to write user stories and acceptance criteria for)
- Finished writing out user stories, left them in the doc for team to review
- Helped draft up storyboard, drew mock ups of potential pages at university with group
